# **Dijkstra Algorithm**
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later

## Let's imagine
You must go to a Warsaw from a Berlin, to destination point are variety of a routes, but 'Which is the **shortes**?'. To get answer in the simplest way you should utilize a Dijkstra Algorithm, whose will give you the shortest path, and you don't have to waste time to get same answer manually. Also is possible by look on problem in reverse to obtain the most distant path

## Where Dijkstra is using?
> In digital maps technologies like: 
> * Navigations (worth to notice: Google Maps, Apple Maps), 
> * Cars HMI maps (Skoda, Bentlay, Masseratti, BMW, etc...), 
> * Food delivery (Uber Eats, Just Eat, etc...),
> * Parcel suppliers software (UPS, DHL, FedEx, etc...), 
> * Modern Fighter jets HUD (main display) or HMD (display built-in helmet) like within: F15EX Eagle 2, F35, F22, Su-57

## Why project is here?
To show how dijkstra can be make with a complexity in a different languages and in such compare between
